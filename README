There are no known bugs in our code.

We did not implement any extra features.

We created tests for the following cases:

    Test Coverage = 86.9%

    In basic_test.go we test the complete functionality of the program in simple and hard tests indicated by the
    the given upperbound and number of miners. The more comprehensive tests here mine with a much larger upperbound.
    We also have created test files for Client, Pool, and Miner error handling and functionality.

    Client: In client_test we perform pool-client connection tests as well as client functionality testing

    Miner: In miner_test we test the miner-pool connection to ensure that the pool correctly handles our miners
    as well as correctly delegate information received from them.

    Pool: Since the majority of written logic is located in pool.go we made sure to create robust test cases for
    pool_test.go. We initially test poolside client/miner connection error handling as well as pool mining functionality
    given certain errors. We test busy pool connections, duplicate ports, disconnection errors and bad messages.

    We also include benchmark testing to test mining performance.
